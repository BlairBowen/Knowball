## Abstract

Knowball is the digital realization of a common game among friends. It is designed to explore how a human concept like obscurity might be quantified
computationally. The centerpiece of that design is our “obscurity engine,” a machine learning model tuned to evaluate athletes based
on achievements, social capital, and more. Knowball, the game, is a fun means of interacting with the engine. Players will name
athletes in response to prompts and be scored per the engine’s outputs of athlete obscurity. The player will see a target of the combined top 5 obscurity
scores for the prompt. We expect the engine to be a unique solution that agrees with our human interpretation of obscurity.
This project blends our interest in sports with a deep dive into how computational models can handle vague concepts like obscurity.

## Abstract

Knowball is the digital realization of a common game among friends. It is designed to explore how obscurity might be quantified
computationally. The centerpiece of that design is our “obscurity engine,” a logical structure tuned to evaluate athletes based
on achievements, social capital, and more. Knowball, the game, is a fun means of interacting with the engine. Players will name
athletes in response to prompts and be scored per the engine’s outputs. Top scores will appear on leaderboards as a competitive,
sporting bonus. We expect the engine to be a unique solution that agrees with our human interpretation of obscurity, and we expect
the game to be playable online. This project blends our interest in sports with a deep dive into how deterministic models can
handle vague concepts like obscurity.

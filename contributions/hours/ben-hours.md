# Justification of Hours

> Ben Cimini (ciminibb@mail.uc.edu), CS

I don’t have an exact sum of my hours contributed to Knowball. However, I can say with absolute confidence that I worked well over
45 hours in each semester—I likely spent double that in the spring. My responsibilities were many and wide-ranging. I designed,
implemented, and maintained both the backend and UI, two major components of the project. Most time on the backend was spent sourcing
and cleaning our dataset, before pipelining it to Azure; most time on the frontend was spent on implementation, iteratively adding
new functionality and correcting past mistakes. I was also responsible for many documentation and bookkeeping tasks. To name a few, I
made our spring design presentation and poster in their entirety. To reiterate, even without an exact number, I well-exceeded the
capstone workload expectations, and my teammates would echo that sentiment.

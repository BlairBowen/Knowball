- As a sports fan, I want fresh, challenging trivia about my favorite leagues and players to exercise the depth of my knowledge.
- As a social creature, I want a shareable and consistent game from player to player, so that I can compete and discuss with friends.
- As someone with a busy schedule, I want a quick game, one I can play for a mental break that isn’t overly distracting.
- As a learner, I want to compare people’s obscurity for novelty and insight into the concept.
- As a developer, I want access to a professional, publicly-available codebase, so I can reference the unique obscurity engine for my own projects.

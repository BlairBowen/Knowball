# User Stories

These stories capture the purpose of our project from users' perspectives.

- As a sports fan, I want to be quizzed about my favorite leagues, teams, and players to test the depth of my knowledge.
- As a social creature, I want my friends and I to receive the same trivia for better comparison of our scores.
- As someone who enjoys healthy competition, I want to see myself on a leaderboard to gauge how good of a player I am.
- As a busy person, I want a quick, simple game for a mental break that isn’t an undue distraction from my responsibilities.
- As a game developer, I want an API for an “obscurity engine” to bring a unique mechanism into my projects without implementing it myself.

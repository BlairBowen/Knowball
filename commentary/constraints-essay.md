For our senior design project, the Knowball Obscure Athlete Game, there are four key constraints that may shape our design and implementation of this game.

One of these constraints is **data availability**. To ensure that we have the widest range of obscure athletes possible, we need a comprehensive and accurate database containing athlete names, statistics, and accolades. Acquiring this data can be challenging, as many sports databases have restrictions, limited access, or incomplete records for lesser-known athletes. This constraint could influence our solution by requiring us to rely on open-source or paid data, which could either limit the range of data or incur more charges than we originally expected.

Another constraint could be the **legality of data collection**. If we attempt to take an alternative route of web scraping to gather the necessary data from websites, we must ensure compliance with relevant laws and terms of service imposed by these sites. Unauthorized scraping could result in legal challenges or restrict future use of the website. This may alter our solution by forcing us to rely on paid sources to obtain the required data.

This leads us to the constraint of the **economics of the project**. Some data sources may require subscriptions or licensing fees, and hosting the game could potentially lead to substantial server costs. Managing these expenses is essential for our project, especially since we only have access to limited personal funds for development. This could influence our solution by pushing us to find cost-effective or free solutions for data and hosting.

One of our bigger constraints/challenges is the **differences in the weight of accolades across sports**. For example, an accolade in one sport (e.g., MVP titles in football) may be considered more or less significant than in another sport (e.g., MVP titles in basketball), thus affecting how obscure or well-known athletes are. These differences must be accounted for to ensure that our obscurity engine is fair across various prompts between sports. This influences our solution by requiring us to build in a weighting system that balances the significance of accolades across different sports.

# Individual Assessment

> Ben Cimini (ciminibb@mail.uc.edu), CS

My capstone project should be the culmination of my academic career. It should be not just comprehensive, but challenging;
not just novel, but quality. Those are nice words, but they don’t mean much without recognizing this essential truth: this
project is a long-term commitment, and its success ultimately depends on continued engagement. Therefore we, as a team, must
combine our technical and personal interests for an idea that remains interesting throughout the year. Knowball is such an
idea. It poses a sufficient technical challenge that orbits around our shared love for sports and the many stories, heroes,
and villains they create.

I’ve completed several projects as a Bearcat. In ENED 1100 and 1120, I made a LEGO robot; in MECH 1072, I modeled an engine;
in EECE 3093C, I developed a betting aggregator; in CS 4065, I wrote a client-server message board. None of those projects had
the breadth nor the depth of Knowball, but they taught me the skills to handle it. Not only me, I should say. I worked with
Blair and Stetson on a few of those projects, too! Their most potent lesson was project management, which is easy to understand
yet difficult to execute. Poor management is, all too often, a project killer – but I’ll make sure it isn’t for us. Of course, my
grasp of theory will also be useful. For example, CS 3003 exposed me to several programming languages that will certainly be part
of Knowball; also, CS 4071 taught me essential algorithms that could improve its performance. Algorithmic thinking is of special
importance to us, since we aim to compute athletes’ obscurity deterministically.

My co-ops taught me a great deal, though less theory and more practical, enterprise-level development skills. It’s worth noting
that, though I spent all my co-ops with Lubrizol, I started as a mechanical engineer. The role wasn’t entirely relevant to software,
but a few, important things were. That semester, I learned to keep a safety-focused mindset – the importance of which is undervalued
in tech circles. After all, applications need to be secure and tolerant against common faults like an overloaded database. Speaking
of which, my Custom Applications and Data Intelligence roles were great practice in database design and development. I built databases
for an onboarding application, a feedback tool, request forms, and a corporate planning portal. They were simple systems but required
me to use Entity Relationship Diagrams, normalization methods, and more. Those tools will be essential to the Knowball backend, where
we will cache outputs from our Obscurity Engine, keep a bank of trivia questions, power daily leaderboards, and more.

We considered many projects from many sources; we reached out to faculty, nonprofits, and employers in search of opportunities. Then,
Dr. Hawkins gave some influential advice. I even paraphrased it at the start of this essay: the biggest factor in a successful capstone
is remaining interested. So, we brainstormed, using common interests like music, travel, and sports as a springboard. Ideas like a
playlist generator from biometric data were just pipped by Knowball which, ultimately, was just the most fun. The time we spent mimicking
the game was proof of its potential.

The game is simple, Wordle-esque even. Each day, a new set of trivia questions will be made available to players – one per sport. The
questions are answerable with a set of athletes, from which players will attempt to enter five. More obscure athletes receive more points.
This is, essentially, a fun means of interacting with our Obscurity Engine, the true heart of the project. The engine will be a computational
entity that considers statistics, achievements, social media analytics, search trends, publications, and more to deterministically quantify
the obscurity of athletes. From what we can tell, no other such solutions exist, at least none that are publicly available. Therefore,
developing the engine will be a unique exploration into the capacity to handle vagueness computationally. That’s all I’ll say about Knowball’s
design for now, since full detail is provided elsewhere in the repository. Instead, I’ll discuss our expectations. Each member’s priority is to
receive an “A” grade. Any greater results, like recognition at the expo, are a bonus. Therefore, our “good job” is conducting each phase –
design, documentation, development, presentation – professionally and with commitment; our “done” is fulfilling our design, though it may change
throughout the process. The game will be available to play, look polished, and run smoothly.

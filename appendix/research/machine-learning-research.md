# Machine Learning in the Obscurity Engine  
This document explores how ML can enhance the Obscurity Engine’s ability to determine the obscurity of professional athletes effectively and innovatively.

## Major Uses for ML in Knowball  
>#### Conclusions  
>Incorporating ML can improve the accuracy and adaptability of the Obscurity Engine by enabling it to analyze data on athletes in dynamic ways. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** could help us create better prompts and parse useful "popularity metrics," while **Clustering Algorithms** can refine how the engine defines and quantifies "obscurity."  

> By implementing ML thoughtfully, the Obscurity Engine can become a more robust and dynamic system for identifying and analyzing the obscurity of athletes. With that said, however, it might add more complexity to the project than originally intended and required overall.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- **Purpose**: Analyze and interpret user inputs to match athlete queries with relevant data.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Parsing user descriptions of athletes to match with database entries.  
  - Identifying contextual hints about an athlete’s popularity or niche recognition based on textual content in articles, tweets, or bios.  
  - Providing smarter, context-driven autocomplete suggestions.  

---

### Clustering Algorithms  
- **Purpose**: Group athletes based on shared characteristics that contribute to their obscurity.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Categorizing athletes by niche sports, regional popularity, or unique career statistics.  
  - Defining tiers of obscurity to provide users with better search filters and discovery options.

### Sentiment and Popularity Analysis  
- **Purpose**: Leverage social media and web data to quantify public interest in an athlete.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Aggregating and analyzing mentions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit.  
  - Scoring athletes on how frequently and positively they are mentioned relative to their peers.

## Considerations  
- **Data Sources**:  
  - Requires reliable access to diverse datasets, such as athlete databases, social media, and news archives.  
- **Bias Risks**:  
  - Algorithms must account for regional, sport-specific, and time-based biases (which could be useful) in data.  
- **Scalability**:  
  - Continuous updates to reflect the latest events, trends, and mentions in sports data.

# Front-End Framework Research  
This document summarizes findings about which front-end framework will be best for your project.  

---

## Major Frameworks  
> #### Conclusions  
> There are 3 main front-end framework options we should consider:  
> - **React** offers flexibility, an extensive ecosystem, and scalability, making it a versatile choice for dynamic web applications.  
> - **Vue.js** is excellent for simplicity and ease of learning, ideal for smaller projects or rapid prototyping.  
> - **Angular** is powerful for enterprise-level projects with complex requirements but has a steep learning curve.  

> For our project, I think that we should lean towards using Vue.js as it is the easiest to pick up and use. The other two options are also valid choices, however. Given that Ben and I have used React before, there is some familiarity there, and with a larger user base, tutorials will be easier to find. Angular can also be a good choice since it promotes the use of static typing, which could make our code more bug-resistant.

### Angular  
**Overview**  
- Features a comprehensive set of tools and enforces a strict "Angular way" of structuring projects.  

**Advantages**  
- Comprehensive and feature-rich out of the box.  
- Suited for large-scale applications that require strict structure and maintainability.  
- Offers TypeScript integration for better code quality.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Steep learning curve due to enforced structure and required knowledge of TypeScript.  
- Historically introduced breaking changes.

### React  
**Overview**  
- Lightweight by default but allows integration of third-party libraries to expand functionality.  

**Advantages**  
- Flexible and unopinionated, letting developers choose tools and libraries based on project needs.  
- Stable API design minimizes breaking changes, making it reliable for long-term projects.  
- Supports React Native for building native mobile applications.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Requires learning JSX, a syntax extension blending HTML and JavaScript, and build tools like Babel and Webpack.  
- Scaling and structuring projects require more work as React doesnâ€™t enforce a specific methodology.

### Vue.js  
**Overview**  
- Offers an intuitive syntax and minimal setup, making it accessible to beginners.  

**Advantages**  
- Easiest to learn among the three frameworks, with intuitive templating and minimal additional tooling.  
- Single-file components keep code organized, aiding scalability.  
- Stable updates, with only two breaking changes since its release.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Less "opinionated" than Angular, requiring developers to define their own structure for scaling projects effectively.

## Learning Curve  
- **Angular**: The most complex, requiring knowledge of TypeScript, dependency injection, and Angular-specific concepts (e.g., modules, directives, decorators). Initial setup is slower but improves productivity for large teams and complex applications.  
- **React**: Medium difficulty. Requires learning JSX and React-specific concepts like states, props, and hooks. Offers boilerplates to simplify setup.  
- **Vue.js**: Simplest to learn, allowing developers to use existing HTML and JavaScript knowledge. Single-file components and minimal tooling streamline the learning process.

## Abstract

Knowball is the digital realization of a common game among friends. It is designed to explore how obscurity might be quantified
computationally. The centerpiece of that design is our “obscurity engine,” a logical structure tuned to evaluate athletes based
on achievements, social capital, and more. Knowball, the game, is a fun means of interacting with the engine. Players will name
athletes in response to prompts and be scored per the engine’s outputs. Top scores will appear on leaderboards as a competitive,
sporting bonus. We expect the engine to be a unique solution that agrees with our human interpretation of obscurity, and we expect
the game to be playable online. This project blends our interest in sports with a deep dive into how deterministic models can
handle vague concepts like obscurity.

## Further Discussion

#### Existing Solutions

There is no shortage of sports trivia games you could play right now. Clearly, that isn’t the most interesting aspect of Knowball –
the obscurity engine is. So, does something similar already exist? The short answer is no, not really; the long answer follows. A
knee-jerk reaction to the prospect of computing something subtle and vague like obscurity is “Well, AI could probably handle it!”
Transparently, our first designs were AI-based. With enough prompting, LLMs could estimate an athlete’s obscurity, but without the
consistency or conciseness Knowball is targeting. Still, they could help with the question at hand: “Does Knowball exist?” Here’s what
ChatGPT had to say.

Let’s not take that at face value, though. Digging deeper, there are many individual metrics by which you could approximate obscurity.
In that regard, social media analytics, search engine trends, bibliometric analysis, and fan communities are all existing services that,
by design or otherwise, perform a similar computation. Knowball will stand out by consuming several such services for a balanced, richly
informed take on obscurity. It is designed to be a source of truth, not a contributor.
